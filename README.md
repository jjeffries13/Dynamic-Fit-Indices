# "DFI"?
## Demystifying Dynamic Fit Indices in a Confirmatory Factor Analysis Framework

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit indices for structural equation modeling approaches provide validity evidence to researchers who must identify whether a model is correctly specified and fits the data well, or if misspecifications occurred during the conception of the model. Theoretical models are an approximation of the truth and model fit indices help measure their distance from it. Traditional (fixed) fit index cutoff guidelines were determined in the landmark and influential research of Hu & Bentler (1999) who conducted a simulation study to arrive at cutoff values that consistently held rejection rates of correctly-specified and misspecified models within a particular model subspace. Yet, they cautioned that these suggested cutoffs may not generalize to other conditions or model subspaces. Dynamic fit indices (DFI) present an opportunity to benefit from similar simulation techniques that hold the same rejection rates as Hu & Bentler (1999), but accommodate for the characteristics and behavior of the model under evaluation. This customizable system can also differentiate degree and quantify magnitude of model misspecification. This presentation will conclude with the introduction to McNeish & Wolf's (2021) {dynamic} R package and Shiny app for those averse to R.
